# üìò Public Policy Navigation Using AI

An AI-powered system designed to simplify navigation and understanding of **public policy documents**.  
The project extracts text from lengthy policy PDFs, summarizes them, and allows users to ask **natural language questions** for quick answers.  

---

## üöÄ Features
- **OCR-based text extraction** from PDF policy documents.  
- **Summarization** of large and complex policy sections.  
- **Question Answering (Q&A)** using NLP models.  
- **JSON-based storage** for structured and reusable data.  
- Simple **CLI/GUI interface** for users.  

---

## üéØ Problem Statement
Public policies are often lengthy, unstructured, and filled with technical or legal jargon.  
Traditional keyword-based search fails to provide **context-aware answers**.  
This project addresses the gap by using **AI and NLP** to make policies more accessible.  

---

## üìå Objectives
- Process and structure public policy documents.  
- Enable **AI-driven summarization** of large texts.  
- Support **natural language queries** for retrieving policy details.  
- Provide a user-friendly interface for researchers, students, and citizens.
